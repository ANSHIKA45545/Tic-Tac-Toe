## Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe game** implemented in Java.  
The game is played in the **console** by two players: `X` and `O`.  
Players take turns to place their marks on the 3×3 board until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw.

---

## 🎮 How to Play
1. The game starts with player **X**.
2. Each player is asked to enter a row and column (0, 1, or 2).
3. The move is placed if the cell is empty; otherwise, the player is asked to try again.
4. The first player to align 3 marks in a **row, column, or diagonal** wins.
5. The winning player is displayed on the console.

## 🛠️ Features
- Two-player console-based game.
- Input validation (prevents invalid positions and overwriting moves).
- Displays the game board after each move.
- Detects winning conditions across rows, columns, and diagonals.
